Things have been too hectic to post regular updates, but between the [previous woven unravelling]({% post_url 2019-07-03-unravelling-shape-weaving %}) and now, I actually did some more weaving and unravelling. I scaled the technique up to a larger piece with a more complex shape (i.e. curved, non-rectilinear edges), which meant that I also needed a larger, more complex loom.

I used the rigid heddle loom (Schacht Cricket), which had already been warped for sampling. I used the doubled warp method in a supplemental warp on top of the ground warp.

The final piece was used as an analog input (a potentiometer or position sensor) in a simple circuit. Our cheesy name for it was the "Smart Circle".
