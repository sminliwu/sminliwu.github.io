![Diagrams of 3 shape weaving experiments' warp systems](/assets/img/diagrams.png)

Summarizing my three experiments in shape weaving with diagrams of their warp systems. Detailing the methods with weaving/design tactics used before (warping), during (weaving), and after (securement).

## Experiment 1: Knotted Pairs

Before: warp an even number, enough room to create the shape

During: when shifting over pick rows for shaping, shift over by 2's; begin and end each pick with 2 ends of plainweave (under and over/over and under)

After: cut warps, leaving at least 2" ends; use square knots to tie each pair securely and tightly against the edge of weft; trim close to knots

## Experiment 2: Tightened Continuous Warp

Before: warp enough room to create the shape

During: plainweave edges as in experiment 1

After: do not cut warps; remove from loom and tighten warp looms against weft one by one; trim excess warp

## Experiment 3: Tightened Continuous Paired Warp

![Diagram of shape weaving experiment 3](/assets/img/diagram3.png)

Before: warp an even number, enough room to create the shape; the warp should start and end on the front/bottom of the loom

During: treat each pair of warps as one single thread, never split them; finish weaving with one last row of plainweave in a separate piece of yarn, this time splitting the pairs (over-under every end)

After: do not cut warps; remove from loom and tighten as in experiment 2
