## Installation Sources

This project was also built on top of the first two class projects, described in this [previous post]({% post_url 2019-09-30-raspberry-pi-pyqt-gui %}) and [this post]({% post_url 2019-10-28-websockets-python-nodejs %}), so these installations were in addition to the ones listed there.

### Server (Raspberry Pi)
- Follow the instructions from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to [set up AWS IoT Greengrass on the Raspberry Pi.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/gg-gs.html) (Modules 1-3) Other AWS services used:
    - AWS Lambda
    - AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS)
    - AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS)
    - AWS MQTT (built into IoT)
- Install the AWS SDK for Javascript (`aws-sdk`) for Node.js.

#### Client (another machine)
- Enable [JQuery](http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js) by including this source in the HTML.
- Enable [AWS connections in a browser](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/js/aws-sdk-2.553.0.min.js) by including this source in the HTML.

## Issues

**#1. Connecting to MQTT:** Because we originally set up MQTT on one of our Pi's, but later ported it to the other Pi, we realized that we had not completely changed over the security credentials so that AWS would recognize the other PI.

**#2. Setting up the Lambda function:** Lambda functions have many runtime options: Node.JS, Python 3.7, Python 2.7, and many more. When we incorrectly generated a Lambda in Node.JS and then tried to switch it over to Python, there were many small formatting errors because of AWS's template generation, like in the filenames, handler names, etc. It was easier to delete the Lambda and start from scratch. In retrospect, it might have been easier to use Node.JS for the Lambda function, as the function parsed JSON's. Since we were already fairly accustomed with JSON functions in Node.JS, we had to re-learn the function names for Python.

**#3. Configuring Roles, Permissions, Policies:** There were a lot of permissions- and authentication-related forms to match up between AWS services, devices accessing AWS services, and our own accounts.
