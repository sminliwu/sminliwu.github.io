I took this cloth off my loom literally YEARS ago, and never got to finish it in a way I was happy with. I decided that I wanted the color blocks to be separated by a thin band of white (matching the warp yarn). 

Yarns in weaving generally aren't glued together, so I'm using a tapestry needle to insert new rows of cotton plainweave. I'm finding that a plastic tapestry needle is *much* more efficient than a metal tapestry needle. The flexibility of plastic makes weaving in and out of the cloth easier.
