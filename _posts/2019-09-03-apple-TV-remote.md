Design charrette - inspired by Don Norman's work, a short, collaborative meeting to quickly collaborate on or sketch ideas in order to share a broad diversity of design ideas. Our task: redesign the Apple TV Remote.

# The Problem

The Apple TV remote is often blasted for it's all-form-no-function design. It's sleek, minimal, and versatile with 4 simple buttons including home and volume, and an integrated touch gesture sensor. The design in general is almost perfectly symmetrical visually and tactilely, which confuses many users, causing them to pick it up the wrong way or accidentally touch the gesture sensor. 

# The Team

Mengchen, Lucy, and Shanel

# The Results

We unfortunately didn't sketch any of our ideas out, just scribbled the words on paper/screen. We converged on our most drastic, maybe even extreme ideas to get rid of the whole remote. Instead, we would design the Apple TV to sync with other Apple smart devices, such as a watch, phone, or laptop. We stuck with this direction because we all felt strongly that the TV-remote paradigm is in the process of being replaced by the PC/laptop-streaming paradigm. Millenials are killing TV's.

# The Process

## My individual ideas

- Bracelet (total form overhaul)
- Slightly modify current design with visual cues like color-coding ends
- Weight the current design differently, which may encourage different gestures
- Sync iPod or iPhone - use other Apple products and integrate those interactions

## Meeting as a group

- We all came up with a variety of modifications to the current remote design: different weight distribution, color-coding, different button placements that are asymmetrical.
- Other ideas diverged from the current form factor, such as a trackpad on a flat surface.
- We progressed to even more drastic changes, such as entirely doing away with a remote-like device by syncing other Apple products. We were inspired by existing touch and gesture sensing on other products like the Apple Watch or iPhone.
