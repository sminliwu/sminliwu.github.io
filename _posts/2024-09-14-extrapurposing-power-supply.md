Buying like 50 pairs of these barrel-plug-to-screw-terminal connectors was one of the most versatile electronics decisions I've made. This is a 12V power supply to an old Microsoft Surface Pro that I still use, but not as frequently as I used to. I happened to need a 12V power supply for other things, so without sacrificing its original purpose, the barrel connectors let me add new functionality!
