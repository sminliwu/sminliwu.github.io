Pinterest is one of the more tolerable social media sites for me, though it's really not all that "social" in terms of user-to-user interactions. It's also not great as a "media" site, as far as properly cataloguing the history of a piece of media and who created it, if you think about it. So many of the pinned images are improperly attributed or completely missing attribution to the creators.

I found several scanned pages of a Ukrainian crochet magazine (Russian language), Duplet, which contained all sorts of gorgeous crochet lace patterns. These patterns were fully charted, which meant that someone like me, who has ZERO ability to read Russian, could use them. I have a ton of practice deciphering visual design instructions, beginning as a kid with learning origami from a Japanese kit with very detailed pictures, so your mileage may vary.
