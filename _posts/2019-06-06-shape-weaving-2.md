I used the pin loom for this experiment, along with a small stick shuttle because I couldn't find the big plastic weaving needle. The pin loom allows for a continuous warp (that could even be continuous with the weft). Usually, you would weave a square as large as the loom, following the exact configuration of the pins.

However, I tried this method to make other shapes. First, I wove a small square by wrapping the warp back and forth, catching every pin until there were 14 warp ends on the loom. I wove the weft in a normal plainweave and left a short tail at both the beginning and end. Once the weft was cut, I took the piece off the pins and began tightening the loops of warp until they were snug against the weft.

I captured pictures of this finishing process with my second try, where I wove a diamond shape. With this diamond, like the first shape weaving experiment, I created sloped edges by increasing or decreasing by 2 warps on each end.

This method probably wouldn't be feasible on a more complex loom, where the warp would have to be threaded through heddles and couldn't be removed from pins. However, I might have an idea for that, where each warp end is doubled in a loop.
