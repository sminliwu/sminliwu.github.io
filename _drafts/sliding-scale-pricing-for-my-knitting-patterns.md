Continuing my thoughts on re-engaging with Ravelry, pattern cataloging, pricing equity, etc. Writing out my sliding scale policy used in selling my knitwear patterns.

\[Payhip product page as the permalink\]

## Policies

### Base Price

All my patterns are available on a pay-what-you-can sliding scale. The default **base price** represents a median price where I can maintain a sustainable income from pattern sales. (What am I sustaining? I'll talk about that below)

### Paying More

If you are able and willing to pay more than the base price, I would be extremely grateful if you did! In my sliding scale model, the people who pay extra directly make it possible for someone else to pay less, or even nothing. To pay **more** than the base price, enter the amount you choose in the "Pay what you want" box, before clicking "Buy Now" or "Add to Cart".

### Paying Less

To **lower** the base price to a level accessible to you, click "Buy Now" or "Add to Cart" on the pattern page. In checkout, you'll see a prompt to "Add coupon" below the payment options. Use one the following coupon codes:

* **PIPER1** - 10% off
* **PIPER2** - 20% off
* **PIPER3** - 30% off

### Free Patterns?

In the future, I hope to perhaps offer free copies of my patterns, funded by people who bought patterns at higher than the base price, or maybe Patreon (if I restart that), or other sources of funds available to me. I'm not really sure how this will work yet. The major open questions in my head are how many patterns can be offered given some amount of funding, how to distribute the patterns fairly (I would prioritize BIPOC + queer/trans + disabled + intersectionally marginalized folks), and how to make sure the system is sustainable.

## Pooled Funds

## The Model

In an ideal world, where I would be able to sell patterns according to a living wage, I'd set the default prices higher. However, I'm not really sure how to determine that price, since each pattern takes countless hours of writing, editing, testing, and promoting, not to mention the hours which I'll have to spend after publication in supporting makers who reach out to me with questions/feedback on the pattern they've purchased. As a product, a handcraft pattern is hard to bound or place a value on. (And I'll just refer to handcraft patterns as "patterns" from here.) It makes more sense to me to see a pattern as a portion of information. When information is valuable, it becomes knowledge. In a capitalist, colonial framework, we measure value in monetary units, creating a product. (I need to read more economics, obviously)

I can't even begin to imagine how value systems would work in my ideal anti-capitalist, decolonized dream-world, but where I can start is a functional understanding of the current system.

### Pattern as Commodity

If we treat a pattern as a commodity that I sell as a designer, for crafters to purchase, then it comes with the access restrictions of commodities. Someone who has bought a commodity has rights to access it, while someone who hasn't does not have access.

For example, you buy fruit from a farm stand, and now you have fruit from that farmer. However, fruit is a finite material good, and that farmer could sell out. If a pattern is a commodity, it is an immaterial one where any limits on its supply would be completely arbitrary limits on how many people can access it.

### Pattern as Service

We could alternatively treat a pattern as a service provided by the designer. As someone who has worked several service jobs, I see a service as labor that I do for the recipient's benefit. Labor takes time and energy directly from myself, so the supply is determined by my own human limits. I quite like that reminder that designing takes real work that can exhaust me if I do too much.

However, tutoring is also a service I've performed. Unlike selling patterns, I only get paid for the time that I'm directly interacting with students. A pattern could be seen as an intermediary or proxy for me, communicating my design to the crafter on my behalf.

### Pattern as Space

One more way I could see patterns is as a space that the designer is providing access to. Or perhaps, the pattern is an access point to the designer's space.

Going purely off of what I remember from high school, all of these things -- commodities, services, spaces -- are subject to supply and demand
