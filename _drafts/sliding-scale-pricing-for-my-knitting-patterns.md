Continuing my thoughts on re-engaging with Ravelry, pattern cataloging, pricing equity, etc.

## Policies

All patterns available on a pay-what-you-can sliding scale. The default **base price** represents a median price where I can maintain a sustainable income from pattern sales.

If you are able and willing to pay more than the base price, I would be extremely grateful if you did! In my sliding scale model, the people who pay extra directly make it possible for someone else to pay less, or even nothing. To pay **more** than the base price, enter the amount you choose in the "Pay what you want" box, before clicking "Buy Now" or "Add to Cart".

To **lower** the base price to a level accessible to you, click "Buy Now" or "Add to Cart" on the pattern page. In checkout, you'll see a prompt to "Add coupon" below the payment options. Use one the following coupon codes:

* **PIPER1** - 10% off 
* **PIPER2** - 20% off 
* **PIPER3** - 30% off
