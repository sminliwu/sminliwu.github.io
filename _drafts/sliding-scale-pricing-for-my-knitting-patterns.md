Continuing my thoughts on re-engaging with Ravelry, pattern cataloging, pricing equity, etc.

All patterns available on a pay-what-you-can sliding scale. Use the following coupon codes (first, click "Add to Cart" then input codes) to adjust the base price to a level accessible to you: PIPER1 - 10% off // PIPER2 - 20% off // PIPER3 - 30% off
