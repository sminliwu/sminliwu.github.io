Continuing my thoughts on re-engaging with Ravelry, pattern cataloging, pricing equity, etc. Writing out my sliding scale policy used in selling my knitwear patterns.

## Policies

### Base Price

All my patterns are available on a pay-what-you-can sliding scale. The default **base price** represents a median price where I can maintain a sustainable income from pattern sales. (What am I sustaining? I'll talk about that below)

### Paying More

If you are able and willing to pay more than the base price, I would be extremely grateful if you did! In my sliding scale model, the people who pay extra directly make it possible for someone else to pay less, or even nothing. To pay **more** than the base price, enter the amount you choose in the "Pay what you want" box, before clicking "Buy Now" or "Add to Cart".

### Paying Less

To **lower** the base price to a level accessible to you, click "Buy Now" or "Add to Cart" on the pattern page. In checkout, you'll see a prompt to "Add coupon" below the payment options. Use one the following coupon codes:

* **PIPER1** - 10% off
* **PIPER2** - 20% off
* **PIPER3** - 30% off

### Free Patterns?

In the future, I hope to perhaps offer free copies of my patterns, funded by people who bought patterns at higher than the base price, and maybe Patreon (if I restart that), as well as other sources of funds available to me. I'm not really sure how this will work yet. The major open questions in my head are how many patterns can be offered given some amount of funding, how to distribute the patterns fairly (I would prioritize BIPOC + queer/trans + disabled + intersectionally marginalized folks), and how to make sure the system is sustainable.

I don't have comments set up for this blog at this moment, but if you have thoughts or requests for what you'd like to see from me, feel free to drop me an email at pipernellart@gmail.com.
