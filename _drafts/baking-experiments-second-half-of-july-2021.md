I swear, I'm not turning this into a food blog. Making food has always been a restorative activity for me. Baking, in particular, has become a major fun activity in the past couple years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of my days off from work have been spent in baking marathons, since travelling wasn't an option, and it's really hard for me to think about work when I have some baking process to monitor or new recipe to research. The second half of this month, July 2021, was marked by a major paper deadline _and_ my birthday, so I really needed to force a break on myself.

## Cheesecake

I've been floating the idea of a birthday cheesecake for months now, as a type of cake I've been wanting to make. I'm still scared of trying actual batter cake, but cheesecake seemed close enough to pie to be achievable. A friend randomly off-loaded a giant bag of sour cream onto our house, and I started wondering if sour cream was an ingredient in cheesecake. Turns out, yes!

When I'm trying out a new class of recipes, I do some research on the top Internet results and my go-to sources. Of the first few "basic" or "classic" cheesecake recipes I found:

* [AllRecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25958/basic-cheesecake)
* [Food Network](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/classic-cheesecake-recipe2-2012236)
* [King Arthur Baking](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/easy-cheesecake-recipe)
* [Sally's Baking Addiction](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/classic-cheesecake/)

Most of them had sour cream in the filling. Of the above links, only the King Arthur recipe doesn't have sour cream. I ended up following Sally's recipe alone because I trust her explanations (learned how to make an awesome pie crust from her blog). I do treat my baking and other culinary forays as experiments, lab notes and all, so I'll go into some highlighted "findings" from my notes.

### Graham Cracker Crust

I love this crust so much. I'm so happy that I now have another option for a dessert shell, since I only had pie crust up to this point. Sally has a recipe post [just for the graham cracker crust](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-make-a-perfect-graham-cracker-crust/) for easy segmentation. I crushed the graham crackers manually using a drinking glass and mixing bowl as mortar and pestle. With only three ingredients (1.5 cups graham crackers / 5 tbsp butter / 0.25 cups sugar = a thick crust covering the bottom of a 9" pie tin), this will be easy to scale up or down for any quantity. Pardon my units, I haven't converted them yet.

### Filling

The most interesting thing about the filling was that the recipe specifies to bring the ingredients to _room temperature_: sour cream, cream cheese, and eggs. This kind of detailed explanation is why I like Sally's recipes, because she not only tells you what to do, but why that is a helpful thing to do. (as a note for anyone who needs to tell me to do something) Room temperature, rather than cold, dairy ingredients will mix more easily and more smoothly without chunks.

### Baking with a Water Bath

Out of all the new things in this baking procedure, the water bath stood out to me.

### Other Notes

* Got the other ingredients in bulk through _COSTCO_, my friends. I did not realize a bulk package of cream cheese would come in a giant, 3-pound log.
* I made a (straw)berry sauce starting with leftover fruit syrup from making pie. The syrup had solidified into gel because of the corn starch, so I added some water and reheated it to re-liquefy. I had a burst of spontaneous genius and added a splash of ros√©.

## Fruit Tart

I loved the graham cracker crust from the cheesecake so much, I started looking up other excuses to make something else with the crust. One of my roommates is lactose-intolerant, so I decided on a fresh fruit tart because the cheesecake was such a dangerous temptation for their digestive system.

### Dairy-Free Custard

The two recipes that I referenced:

* [Dairy-Free Cocunut Custard - What the Fork, a gluten-free blog](https://www.whattheforkfoodblog.com/2016/06/13/dairy-free-coconut-custard/)
* [Vegan Custard - The Minimalist Vegan](https://theminimalistvegan.com/vegan-custard/)
