The statement currently on my Ravelry designer profile page:

> If you are interested in purchasing my patterns, please visit my [Payhip store](https://payhip.com/pipernell). Because I have migrated all of my patterns to Payhip as of April 2021, they will not be available as Ravelry purchases. However, I will leave my pattern pages on Ravelry, as this site is still the most effective knitting and crochet pattern database to date.
>
> To maintain transparency and to share my learning process, I will be archiving previous versions of this designer statement and logging my thoughts on [my blog](https://sminliwu.github.io/blog/).
>
> I continue to urge Ravelry to address the accessibility issues that the new layout has introduced and to sincerely reflect on the damage that their dismissal of community feedback has caused.

Earlier versions:

> I'm selling my designs on Ravelry again, after much internal debate about effective action. TL;DR: since the pandemic began, I've been using all of my income outside of my student stipend to contribute to mutual aid. Ravelry was most of that income. I think it'd be better and more impactful for me to restart that income stream so I can contribute more to my community. you can read the rest of my reasoning on my blog.

For transparency, the old statement:

> I have deactivated my Ravelry store until the site has not only addressed their accessibility issues, but also made amends for their harmful response to community feedback, such as suppressing discussion and refusing to be transparent. As someone who is in UX/human-centered design and works for digital technologies to be equitable and justice-oriented, I can't in good conscience use a platform that doesn't reflect those values.
