What if intersectionality and interdisciplinarity are the same thing? I'm pretty sure this is not an original idea. Which articulating the unoriginality of an idea/work and how it doesn't decrease the intrinsic value of it is something else that I've been having trouble writing down. The idea I'm trying to parse out is how intersectionality relates to interdisciplinarity, and how they might be one and the same in my practice.

This connection was formed when I was listening to an episode of the Conscious Chatter podcast (I've been very sporadic about keeping up with podcasts, and I hit "play" on a random one in my backlog). In that particular episode \[link\], the host had a conversation with Kiana Kazemi, an activist and student of engineering and environmental justice. She's also on the Intersectional Environmentalism (IE) team, a platform/collective/movement (what do we even call any group organizing for change anymore?) that I've been following on social media. Kiana identifies as an "intersectional engineer", a phrase that I'm finding extremely compelling.

Taking a cue from IE's practice of crediting their elders' work, I also want to center how the term "intersectionality" came to be, through the work of Dr. Kimberle Crenshaw \[link\], initially coined in her 1989 paper. Crenshaw drew from her studies in civil rights as a law professor, as well as own experiences as a Black woman (check this? read the source), to write on the compounding effects of race and gender as an "intersection" of experiential layers.

To be honest, when I first heard "intersectional", I didn't know who exactly had coined it. I barely knew who was who in social justice, but I knew that "intersectional" was an intuitive term that resonated with how I experienced multiple dimensions of social identity and marginalization.
