My Kickshaws samples were prone to falling down the back of the foot, which I see as a major design flaw. In the interest of not beating myself up for releasing a pattern that I feel isn't "good enough" (and feeling guilty for that), here's a fix that I've developed.

\[put Kickshaws on Payhip, and put Ravelry link here\] Summarize pattern? Let's go straight to the bones of the pattern hack, and I'll save my ruminating for later.

## Structure/Schematic

Because the back of the slipper was in garter stitch, a very stretchy stitch, the slipper would tend to be loose around the heel and it would be easily pulled down by the heel/sole seam when the wearer moves. An ankle strap adds a band of less-stretchy, higher-tension fabric right above the heel. And since most people's heels form a flared base from the ankle, this band won't want to slip down the heel unless there's a much bigger force (like the wearer tugging the slipper off).

I've provided two different methods:

1. An **embedded i-cord** method for any ongoing or new Kickshaws projects going forward.
2. An **afterthought i-cord** or **crochet row** method for Kickshaws that are past Part 2 or already completed. Alternatively, you could make the Kickshaws as written and adjust the finished slippers with this method.

## Instructions

### Abbreviations

**RS** - right side of work (outside of slipper) // **WS** - wrong side (inside)  
**R**/**L needle__ - right/left needle**  
st** - stitch  
**k** - knit // **p** - purl  
**CO** - cast on  
**sl** - slip stitch // **wyif** - with yarn in front // **wyib** - with yarn in back  
**pm** - place stitch marker // **sm** - slip marker

### 1. Embedded I-cord Method

These instructions begin in Part 2 of the pattern. Work the pattern instructions until the CO for additional stitches (to make the leg of the slipper). In Rows \[x-y\], work the following rows instead of what's written in the pattern:

**Row X (RS, set up):** work first \[x, num cast on + 1\] stitches of row as written, then place a stitch marker. k3, pm, work to end of row.

**Row X+1 (WS):** work row as written until the first marker, sm, sl3 wyif, sm, work to end of row.

**Row X+2 (RS):** work row as written until the first marker, sm, k3, sm, work to end of row.

**Row X+3 (WS):** as Row X+1. Work row as written until the marker, sm, sl3 wyif, sm, work to end of row.

In order for the embedded i-cord to really pop from the fabric, when working WS rows, bunch the 3 slipped sts close together on the needle and pull the next st extra tight so that the float is as short as possible.

Continue working Part 2, through to Part 3, until Row \[z\], when you will bind off the leg stitches. Work the rest of the pattern as written.

### 2. Afterthought Methods

These instructions assume that you have the slipper oriented so that the toe is pointing down and the cuff is pointing to your right. So the ankle strap should first go "up" the work to go around the back of the heel.

#### 2.1 Afterthought I-cord

Use the same needle size you used to knit the slippers. Beginning at point \[a\], marked in the diagram \[b\], use your R needle to pick up and knit three sts in a garter ridge. Slip all three sts to your L needle (or if you're using DPN's, just slide them over) with the yarn in back.

**I-cord Row 1:** Pick up (without knitting) the stitch above the previous row, in the next garter ridge. Slip this stitch onto the L needle, and k2tog. You should still have 3 stitches on the needle. K2, slip 3 to L needle wyib.

**I-cord Row 2:** K3, slip 3 to L needle wyib.

#### 2.2 Afterthought Crochet Row

Disclaimer: I still haven't written a crochet pattern before, and don't consider myself rigorous enough to be a crochet "designer", so instructions on gauge/tension and hook size may be wishy-washy. I use American crochet terms (UK equivalent in parentheses).

Use a crochet hook equivalent to the needle size you used to knit the slippers. If you're an especially tight or loose crocheter, you may need to size up or down accordingly. Beginning at the point \[a\] marked in the diagram \[make diagram with X on ankle where strap starts\], insert your hook into the purl bump of the garter ridge. Make a single crochet (UK: double crochet) stitch.

Move to the next garter ridge and the stitch right above the one you just crocheted into. Make another stitch. Continue around the heel in this way until you reach the equivalent point on the other side of the ankle. \[also point it out on diagram? or have a directional arrow on the first diagram\]
