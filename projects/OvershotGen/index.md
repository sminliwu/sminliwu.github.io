title: Flowing Curves Overshot Generator

---
Spring / Summer 2020

## Project Overview

* [The web version of the generator.](https://sminliwu.github.io/overshot-generator/ "Flowing Curves Overshot Generator")
* [Git repository (GitHub)](https://github.com/sminliwu/overshot-generator "Git repository (GitHub)")

This project started as just a quick tool I hacked to help me design the Ozone Safety Vest \[project link\]. I wanted a leaf-like, freeform overshot pattern on the body and I felt that I needed a way to quickly visualize the pattern possibilities in order to design the threading and some basic treadling combinations.
