title: Loom Pedals V2
season: Fall 2021 / Spring 2022

---

## Project Overview

The loom pedals are a hardware peripheral interface for the TC2 digital Jacquard loom by Tronrud Engineering. They have been designed as a modular system of foot pedals, similar to guitar effects pedals used by musicians, which are connected via a Raspberry Pi to a web-based open source weaving software, AdaCAD.

### \[GitHub repo link forthcoming\] 

## Previous Version

V1 of the loom pedals was built in Fall 2019 by reimplementing Lea's code (see acknowledgments) in Python/QT as a proof-of-concept for an improved GUI with multiple pedals on a Raspberry Pi.

## Acknowledgments

These pedals would not have been possible without the initial work of Lea Albaugh, whose Summer 2019 experiments in underdetermined, improvisational weaving interactions on the TC2 are documented on [their site here](http://www.lea.zone/underdetermined_handweaving.html "Underdetermined Handweaving").
