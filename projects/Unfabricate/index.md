What importance is there in being able to take apart our things? Unfabricate is a smart textiles design project that explores the process of taking apart material objects, focusing on textiles and sometimes electronics. Textiles have been particularly suited for disassembly, as a large majority of pieces do not use any adhesives or sealants during their creation. How can we design and craft textile pieces (e.g. a garment) to be more easily taken apart, unravelled, and reclaimed for their materials?
